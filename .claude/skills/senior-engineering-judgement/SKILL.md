description: Use this skill when making trade-offs, resolving ambiguity, or deciding what not to build.

When exercising senior judgment:

1. Prefer simplicity over flexibility
2. Avoid premature abstractions
3. Follow constraints strictly
4. Reject unnecessary patterns
5. Optimize for correctness first
6. Justify decisions with clear reasoning
7. Use design patterns when needed, but avoid overuse

If a decision cannot be justified clearly, it is likely wrong.
